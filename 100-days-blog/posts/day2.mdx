Despite having been a dev for several years, wiring all of this up is still hard because it's very different than a .NET project, which is my stack of expertise. 

Today, I've been working on getting the markdown pages created dynamically. I decided to go with MDX pages in case that provides an opportunity to mess with components in my markdown later. I've been following the [tutorial on Gatsby for regular markdown files](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-six/), and then I supplemented that with a post from Scott Spence on [creating a blox from MDX pages](https://blog.scottspence.me/build-a-coding-blog-with-mdx-and-gatsby-2019).

I also decided to add in Typography.js and pick a theme to play with (I'm using Ocean Beach). I also added an 'about me' page. So far, adding packages and wiring up new pages has been super easy. I am going to try to deploy this today, and my next session will focus on next and previous links for the blog.
