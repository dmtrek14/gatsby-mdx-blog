For a quick bit of work on this tonight, I added a tags page with a list of all tags used in the blog so far. I'll keep work on enhancing this, so that I can show how many posts have each tag, and perhaps have a listing of blog post titles under each tag.

I added a tags field to the frontmatter of the mdx file. For this post the tags field looks like this:
```js
tags: ["tags", "new page"]
```

My query to get the tags is:
```js
export const query = graphql`
query {
    allMdx(sort: {fields: frontmatter___tags}) {
        edges {
            node {
              fields {
                slug
              }
              id
            }
          }
          group(field: frontmatter___tags) {
            fieldValue
          }
      }
}
`
```
