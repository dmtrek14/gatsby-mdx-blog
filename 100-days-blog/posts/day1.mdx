I've been wanting to really dig into Gatbsy for a while, so the challenge is a good excuse to spend some time doing just that. We are going to be using Gatsby at work to serve up some pages with content from a CMS (Prismic). So, it feels like a good idea to start getting my React and Gatsby skills up to par. 

While I'm new to React and Gatsby, I've been a developer for a while--four years on full-stack, and about ten on front-end stuff. My backend skills are mostly with the .NET stack  (and a tiny bit of ColdFusion and PHP).

So far, what I really like about Gatsby is that it feels a bit like magic. The developer experience is really good and the documentation is solid (at least for a n00b at this). I started with the basic 'hello world' shell and read through the first few steps of the intro tutorial and was able to get up and running pretty quickly.

That's mostly it for this post. I just wanted to get going and see if I could get the blog wired up. I need to work out creating pages dynamically, but hope to have it figured out in my next session.
