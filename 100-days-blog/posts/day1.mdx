## Hello Gatsby Challenge

I've been wanting to really dig into Gatbsy for a while, so the challenge is a good excuse to spend some time doing just that. We are going to be using Gatsby at work to serve up some pages with content from a CMS.

While I'm new to React and Gatsby, I've been a developer for a while--four years on full-stack, and about ten on front-end stuff.
