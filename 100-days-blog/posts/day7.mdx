Today, I am working on inproving the tags page I had before by making the tags link to a list of blog entries with those tags. I have used the Gatsby tutorial on [making a tags index page](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/adding-tags-and-categories-to-blog-posts/). 

I still need to circle back to pagination since I didn't have a chance to get that wired up the other day. And I may try to style this thing up a little better. I haven't done a lot with styled components in React and would like to give that a try. Also on my list to try out is adding images to the blog posts and optimizing as part of Challenge 3.

Another item I will work on today is making the tags at the bottom of each post linkable to the page for that tag.
