In my time for this today, I am going to try adding 'previous' and 'next' links to each blog entry. I don't have as much time to spend today, so depending on how long that takes, I'll work on adding pagination to the blog so that when I get more than ten blog entries, they can be paginated and there isn't a wall of links on the blog home. 

I started the day by creating a development branch, so that I can work in the solution and hose it without messing up my deploy. I've always found it to be good practice to work on bigger features or changes in a branch and merge into master later. 

For today's references, I'm going to be looking again at Scott Spence's post on creating an MDX blog - he has a section on adding previous/next links - and at the Gatsby docs. The React Training site also has a [good tutorial on MDX blogs](https://reacttraining.com/blog/gatsby-mdx-blog/), and their way of graphing the object worked better for me than Scott's.

My next task while we are still in this first challenge will be to add tagging to the blog and a page listing all of the tags.
