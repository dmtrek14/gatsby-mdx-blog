Today, I'm going to try to wire-up a paginated list of results for the blog list (home) page. When the blog gets to be a lot of entries, it will be nice to have a list so users don't have to scroll through so much.

Because I have my index page wired to pull the list, I think I'm going to have to rewrite a few things. Ideally, I think I'd have a list template to bind the pages results to. That's a little more than I have time to do today, so I'm going to circle back.
