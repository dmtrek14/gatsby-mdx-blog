The fourth challenge is out, and it is to add a sign-up form on the About page using formik. I've added the package and the code, but haven't wired up the form to submit at the moment. 

I realized after adding the featured image to the frontmatter of one mdx file that I needed to add that to all existing posts because they were breaking because of that null value. I've simply added the same image to all posts, but I'll probably circle back and change that up.

I did a little more styling work to give this even more of an LCARS feel. I don't know that this is a theme I'd use for any real thing, but it's sure fun to play around with here.

On a separate Gatsby front, I've been working on a proof of concept for a site using Prismic as the backend datasource. Prismic pages the data for you, so I am trying to figure out how to use the cursors they provide to allow users to get to the next set of results.
