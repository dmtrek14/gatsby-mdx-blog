I've had to put some focus on my thesis and big UI re-write at work, so I didn't have a chance to make any improvements yesterday. Tonight, I am going to try to quickly add tags to the blog. I'm going to use the Gatsby [documentation page on how to add tags to markdown files](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/adding-tags-and-categories-to-blog-posts/#add-tags-to-your-markdown-files).

I've noticed that the index numbers I'm pulling for previous and next links are not right, so I'm going to do some debugging on that tomorrow and get it fixed. 

I also want to create a page for tags and show all of them on one page, then be able to click on each one and show posts with that tag.
