Today, I decided to walk through the documentation on [adding images to markdown](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/working-with-images-in-markdown/). I want to get caught up on Challenge number 3 so that I will be ready for Challenge number four this week

I added a featuredImage field to the frontmatter. For the moment, I am placing the featured images in the same folder as the posts. I'm using the following query on my post template page:

```js
mdx(fields: { slug: {eq: $slug } }) {
    fields {
      slug
    }
    frontmatter {
      date
      title
      tags
      featuredImage {
        childImageSharp {
          fluid(maxWidth: 600, quality: 80) {
            ...GatsbyImageSharpFluid
          }
        }
      }
    }
    body
    excerpt(pruneLength: 100)
  }
  ```

  Now I can add a featured image to the post. Next, I might look into showing that image in the list of posts. I like that with the Gatsby Image package, I can control quality and size. For cover images, it will be handy to size everything the same.
